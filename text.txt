Thank you for your interest in a position at Zmags. Listed below are three
Java coding tasks. We ask that you complete at least two of the three tasks
and submit your solution to us. The purpose of this assignment is for us to
get an understanding of your problem solving skills and coding style.
Make sure to include a readme that describes how to use the submitted
code. Add appropriate tests and documentation to validate and describe the
implemented functionality.
